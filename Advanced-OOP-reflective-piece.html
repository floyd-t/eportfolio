  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h2>
  <p>This e-Portfolio reflects on the learning journey throughout the Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Programming module. The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate understanding of advanced OOP principles, secure coding practices and various architectural concepts by linking theory with practical knowledge. The e-Portfolio serves as a way to explain how skills have developed throughout the module, it also outlines a Professional Development Plan (PDP) for continuing growth.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>The module, as well as the Object-Oriented Programming module that was completed alongside it, has covered key learning outcomes such as implementing secure coding practices, applying advanced OOP concepts to complex problems, utilising design patterns to improve software maintainability as well as designing software architectures suitable for large-scale systems. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>The approach taken throughout the module has been highly practical but with a large focus on learning new skills as well as advancing them to a practical level. The development of multiple artefacts, including the previous coding exercises such as the thread-safe banking system from the week 6 submission and a project focused on a humanoid robot system in the OOP module, are some larger scale projects that have not only been successful but also show how new skills have been implemented. These skills are mainly oriented around designing, implementing, and evaluating software solutions. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>This portfolio is divided into five main sections. Firstly a summary of the key learning outcomes and how they were achieved, then a showcase of the artefacts produced during the module, linking them to OOP principles and practical applications. The artefacts will also allow further explanation into the outcomes of the first section. Thirdly a reflection of the academic and employability skills developed, followed by a PDP which identifies strengths, areas for improvement and future goals. Finally, a conclusion will be made summarising how the module has contributed to professional development in regards to advanced OOP practices in the industry.

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Key Learning Outcomes</h2>
  <p>Secure Coding Practices </p>
  <p>One of the central objectives of the module was to understand and implement secure coding practices in software development. This was demonstrated through the thread-safe banking system, where the task was to create a banking application capable of handling concurrent transactions by multiple users. </p>
  <p>The challenge lay in ensuring operations such as deposits and withdrawals were executed correctly without issues arising from multiple users completing transactions at one time. To achieve this, the use of Python’s “threading.Lock” mechanism allowed for the synchronisation of shared resources (i.e., the account balance).</p>
  <p>An important lesson to learn from this exercise is how subtle concurrency issues can compromise data integrity, as well as how secure coding practices must anticipate and mitigate such risks. The implementation of tests further reinforced the importance of validation in secure software design. Simulating multiple concurrent users allowed for the confirmation of the correctness of the solution, proving that secure coding is not just about preventing external threats but also about ensuring internal consistency. </p>
  <br> 
  <br>
  <p>Advanced OOP Principles </p>
  <p>A major focus of the module was the importance of applying advanced OOP principles, for example abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism; these principles were essential in order to solve complex problems. This was particularly evident in the humanoid robot project, which required a design and implementation of a system capable of simulating robot behaviour in an environment.</p>
  <p>I used encapsulation to separate the robot’s internal state with the way it interacted with the world physically. Inheritance was used when simulating different types of sensors, where subclasses extended a base “Sensor” class. Polymorphism enabled the system to treat all sensor data in its processing, while allowing each subclass to implement its specific behaviour. </p>
  <p>UML diagrams including class, sequence, state transition and activity diagrams were used for the system flow and the way in which components interacted. These visual artefacts provided the ability to plan during the design phase and ensured that during the implementation there was clarity on how the system should be structured. </p>
  <p>By structuring the code into packages (core, activities, sequences and tests), The system had ensured reusability and maintainability. The ability to extend the system easily highlighted the utility of advanced OOP principles in creating strong solutions. </p>
