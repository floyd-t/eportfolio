  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h2>
  <p>This e-Portfolio reflects on the learning journey throughout the Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Programming module. The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate understanding of advanced OOP principles, secure coding practices and various architectural concepts by linking theory with practical knowledge. The e-Portfolio serves as a way to explain how skills have developed throughout the module, it also outlines a Professional Development Plan (PDP) for continuing growth.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>The module, as well as the Object-Oriented Programming module that was completed alongside it, has covered key learning outcomes such as implementing secure coding practices, applying advanced OOP concepts to complex problems, utilising design patterns to improve software maintainability as well as designing software architectures suitable for large-scale systems. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>The approach taken throughout the module has been highly practical but with a large focus on learning new skills as well as advancing them to a practical level. The development of multiple artefacts, including the previous coding exercises such as the thread-safe banking system from the week 6 submission and a project focused on a humanoid robot system in the OOP module, are some larger scale projects that have not only been successful but also show how new skills have been implemented. These skills are mainly oriented around designing, implementing, and evaluating software solutions. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>This portfolio is divided into five main sections. Firstly a summary of the key learning outcomes and how they were achieved, then a showcase of the artefacts produced during the module, linking them to OOP principles and practical applications. The artefacts will also allow further explanation into the outcomes of the first section. Thirdly a reflection of the academic and employability skills developed, followed by a PDP which identifies strengths, areas for improvement and future goals. Finally, a conclusion will be made summarising how the module has contributed to professional development in regards to advanced OOP practices in the industry.
