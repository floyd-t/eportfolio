  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h2>
  <p>The application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) requires both a deep understanding of its fundamentals as well as knowledge of the best methods for implementation. Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams and models provide an essential foundation for visualising and planning object-oriented systems. This reflective analysis evaluates the UML diagrams produced during the system design phase for a humanoid robot, and then assesses the implementation into a working Python system. There is an analysis of the role of the class, activity, sequence and state transition diagrams in shaping the system as well as the broader learning outcomes achieved. Finally, the analysis addresses the professional and personal impact of this development process. </p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Artefacts and Application</h2>
  <p>The first key artefact was the class diagram, which provided an abstraction of the robot’s structure and behaviour. It mapped core entities such as the controller, sensors and actuators as well as their attributes and operations. The diagram established clear relationships, which is helpful for supporting modular implementation in Python. For example, the “RobotController” was designed to manage states and behaviours, while sensor and actuator classes were modelled as separate components. This assisted with clean encapsulation and reusability. Below is a screenshot of it:  </p>
